# python-functional-programming

## Purpose
The aim of repository is to be a guide to writing Python code
using [functional programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming)
while maintaing the ability to replace parts of the program using C++ or Rust painlessly.


## Libraries
The following 4 libraries are a must-know when writing functional code in Python:
  - [attrs: Classes Without Boilerplate](https://www.attrs.org/en/stable/)
  - [multipledispatch: Sane approach to Multiple Dispatch in Python](https://multiple-dispatch.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
  - [pyrsistent: Immutable Data Structures](https://pyrsistent.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
  - [toolz: functional programming in python](https://toolz.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

FFI libraries:
  - [pybind11: Seamless operability between C++11 and Python](pybind11.readthedocs.io/)
  - [pyo3: Rust bindings for the Python interpreter](https://pyo3.rs/v0.10.1/)
